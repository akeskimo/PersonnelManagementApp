# SUMMARY
C++ Qt-application for managing personnel and their salaries based on SQLITE database.

# PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT APP

 Your task is to design and implement a company personnel management
 application. Design your application so that the UI part can be replaced easily. You
 should make a simple graphical user interface without graphical user interface builders. 
 
 User interface should contain only basic functionality to set and get relevant information 
 (see tables below). You should also make a simple information structure, where employees can 
 be added and stored. In the following section there is a description of the employee 
 information that your application should be able to contain.
 
 The company has different kinds of workers. The following table tells you what kind
 of information you should save of each worker so that you would then be able to
 print out all this information of all the saved workers at the same time (e.g. in the
 form of a list).
 
 Monthly paid employee            Hourly paid employee                       Salesman
 Name                             Name                                       Name
 Social security number           Social security number                     Social security number
 Monthly compensation             Hourly Compensation                        Monthly compensation
                                  Done hours                                 Bonus %
                                                                             Realized outcome
                                                                             Outcome claim
 
 The workers clearly differ from each other in the salary formation.
 
 Employee                       Salary Formation
 Monthly paid employee          Monthly compensation
 Hourly paid employee           Done hours*hourly compensation
 Salesman                       Monthly compensation raised by the bonus % if the outcome claim comes true
 
 Based on this information you should make a class hierarchy or a data structures
 for your company personnel management application. If you include extra
 functionality in your application you should document them also.
 You can fill up all relevant information that is missing with reasonable assumption.
